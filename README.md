#  Knownn ‚Äì Pseudonymous Community Platform

**Knownn** is a real-time, pseudonymous platform built for colleges and organizations. It brings together individuals with the same email domain (e.g., `@college.edu`) into a private, trusted space where they can share, discuss, and support each other ‚Äî without revealing their identity.

---

## üö® Problem Statement

People often hesitate to share thoughts on career struggles, academic stress, or social issues due to fear of judgment. Existing platforms lack true anonymity or domain-specific relevance, leaving users disconnected from relatable peer communities.

---

## üéØ Objective

To create a safe, domain-restricted community where users can:
- Post and comment anonymously  
- Share content suggestions  
- Report or react without identity exposure  
- Chat in real-time with people they actually know (same college or organization)
